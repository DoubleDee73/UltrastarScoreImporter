# What's the UltrastarScoreImporter?
Ultrastar is a open source Singstar-like Karaoke game. There are multiple different games available, such as Ultrastar CMD, Ultrastar World Party, Ultrastar Deluxe, etc.
You may find yourself wanting to switch from one game to another and would like to import the scores from your previous game to your current game. This little tool may help you with it.
It is a small command line program developed in Java.

# Requirements
- Java 17

# How to run the importer?
1. Copy the jar somewhere and open its location in a command prompt
2. Run the jar like so: `java -jar UltrastarScoreImporter-0.1.jar`
   
It requires two parameters: 1. the path to the Ultrastar.db of your source game and 2. the path to the Ultrastar.db of your target game.

Example
`java -jar UltrastarScoreImporter-0.1.jar "C:\Program Files (x86)\UltraStar WorldParty" "C:\Program Files (x86)\UltraStar Deluxe"`
